# UFC_Fighter_Capstone
The purpose of this project is to analyze UFC fighter statistics and make conclusions based from the data.
I will be asking three questions:
**1. What factors lead to high win %?**
**2. Can I predict the outcome of fights?**
**3. Can I predict who has the potential to become champion?**
Inside this repository are all of the fiels that contain my work. I did aggregations inside of SQL so those are not shown inside of the exported file because they did not change the database. The SQL file only contains the import code for the data. There are a few different versions of the data in here as well just in case somebody wants to use it at differents points throughout the cleaning process.
